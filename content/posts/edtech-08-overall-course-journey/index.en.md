Throughout this course, the group sessions were really interesting—seeing everyone's works and outputs. I think it's great that we're getting the experience needed to actually just create something. There's something deeply valuable about that, that at the end of the day, we're doing things, not just learning.

For our presentation, I found it deeply satisfying to try and reason through how exactly we could teach instructional design frameworks without it being formal, or something that people will just remember as a "list of facts". Perhaps the biggest struggle was how late we had finished and started on the presentation. I think that's something I want to improve on in the future. I'm also really proud of how we integrated the creative aspect and theme directly into the lesson.

Sir's lectures and insights were really the highlights for me. He sparked some really thoughtful questions and ideas. I don't quite remember them clearly (and I wish I wrote them down), but this idea that instructional design and tools are something that everyone benefits from—I find it really insightful.

Overall, EdTech 101 is something I hold deep to my heart, even if I myself am a bit quiet and introverted. It's a course where I feel like my internal thoughts and reflections about education and education research get validated. I think a big part of that really was just about how inclusive our learning environment felt. If I'd only been able to learn how to manage my ADHD and anxiety, I feel like I could've been more present and engaged.
